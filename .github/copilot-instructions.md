## Project Overview
This is a full-stack React and Express.js application with PostgreSQL authentication system. The project consists of:

- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript, modern UI components with CSS animations
- **Backend**: Express.js API with JWT authentication
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for user management
- **Architecture**: RESTful API design with secure authentication

## Code Style Guidelines
- Use TypeScript for all React components and services
- Follow React functional components with hooks pattern
- Use async/await for API calls
- Implement proper error handling and user feedback
- Use CSS modules or styled components for styling
- Follow REST API conventions for backend endpoints

## Authentication Flow
- JWT token-based authentication
- Tokens stored in localStorage
- Protected routes using authentication context
- Automatic token validation on app initialization

## Development Practices
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Follow security best practices for authentication
- Use proper TypeScript types for all data structures
- Implement responsive design principles
